Javascript client for OpenId connect secured REST services

Usage:

1) init client object on page loading
	
	var client;
	$(document).ready(function() {
		client = new bbp.client( { redirect_uri: 'http://bluebrain43.epfl.ch/oidc-clients/js/test/index.html' } );
	});

this will prompt the user to login as soon as it will open the page

2) use the client in your code

	$('#readBtn').click( function() {
		client.get( 'http://localhost:8181/api/collaboration/rest/v1/artifact.json/156243', 
					function(data) {console.log('data received: ', data); }
				   );
	});
